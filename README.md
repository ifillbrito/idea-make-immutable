# Make Immutable (IDEA-Plugin)
This plugin makes a class immutable by applying the following changes:
     
1. Class modifier `final` is added is not present.
2. Fields modifier `final` is added is not present.
3. Constructor/s visibility changed to `private`.
4. Generation of static constructor (method name: `of`) for each private constructor.
5. Generation of `getters`.
6. Generation of `withers` (`withXYZ` Methods).

## Usage

- **Precondition**: This plugin requires the existence of at least one constructor.
- **Expectation**: 
    - The methods are generated only if there is no method matching the signature.
    - `getters` and `withers` are generated based on the class fields and constructors arguments (see example below)
- **Usage**: Code | Generate (Alt + Insert) | Make Immutable

## Example
Let's assume you have the following class (no getters and setters):
```java
public class SomeClass<T, R> {

    private String value1;
    private T value2;
    private R value3;
    private boolean value4;

    public SomeClass(String value1a, String value1b, T value2, R value3, boolean value4) {
        this.value1 = value1a + value1b;
        this.value2 = value2;
        this.value3 = value3;
        this.value4 = value4;
    }
}
```
Then, if you run the plugin 'Make Immutable' you would obtain the following result:
```java
public final class SomeClass<T, R> {

    private final String value1;
    private final T value2;
    private final R value3;
    private final boolean value4;

    private SomeClass(String value1a, String value1b, T value2, R value3, boolean value4) {
        this.value1 = value1a + value1b;
        this.value2 = value2;
        this.value3 = value3;
        this.value4 = value4;
    }

    public static <T, R> SomeClass of(String value1a, String value1b, T value2, R value3, boolean value4) {
        return new SomeClass<>(value1a, value1b, value2, value3, value4);
    }

    public String getValue1() {
        return this.value1;
    }

    public T getValue2() {
        return this.value2;
    }

    public R getValue3() {
        return this.value3;
    }

    public boolean isValue4() {
        return this.value4;
    }

    public String getValue1a() {
        throw new RuntimeException("This method must be implemented."); // TODO
    }

    public String getValue1b() {
        throw new RuntimeException("This method must be implemented."); // TODO
    }

    public SomeClass withValue1a(String value1a) {
        return of(value1a, getValue1b(), getValue2(), getValue3(), isValue4());
    }

    public SomeClass withValue1b(String value1b) {
        return of(getValue1a(), value1b, getValue2(), getValue3(), isValue4());
    }

    public SomeClass withValue2(T value2) {
        return of(getValue1a(), getValue1b(), value2, getValue3(), isValue4());
    }

    public SomeClass withValue3(R value3) {
        return of(getValue1a(), getValue1b(), getValue2(), value3, isValue4());
    }

    public SomeClass withValue4(boolean value4) {
        return of(getValue1a(), getValue1b(), getValue2(), getValue3(), value4);
    }


}
``` 
## TODOs
- [ ] Support for classes without constructror.
This plugin requires the class to have at least 
one constructor (see example above). If there is
no constructor, then the plugin should create a
default one where all the fields are set to the 
Java default values.
