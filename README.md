# Make Immutable IDEA-Plugin
This plugin makes a class immutable by doing the following refactoring:
     
- The class modifier "final" is added is not present.
- All fields modifier "final" is added is not present.
- The constructor visibility is changed to private.
- A static constructor is generated (method name: "of") based on the private constructor.
- Getters are generated.
- With-Methods are generated. This methods allow creating a new immutable object based on the current one.

## Example
Let's assume you have the following class (no getters and setters):
```java
public class Person {
    
    private String lastName;
    private String firstName;
    private LocalDate birthday;

    public Person(String lastName, String firstName, LocalDate birthday) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.birthday = birthday;
    }
}
```
Then, if you run the plugin 'Make Immutable' you would obtain the following result:
```java
public final class Person {

    private final String lastName;
    private final String firstName;
    private final LocalDate birthday;

    private Person(String lastName, String firstName, LocalDate birthday) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.birthday = birthday;
    }

    public static Person of(String lastName, String firstName, LocalDate birthday) {
        return new Person(lastName, firstName, birthday);
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public LocalDate getBirthday() {
        return birthday;
    }

    public Person withLastName(String lastName) {
        return of(lastName, getFirstName(), getBirthday());
    }

    public Person withFirstName(String firstName) {
        return of(getLastName(), firstName, getBirthday());
    }

    public Person withBirthday(LocalDate birthday) {
        return of(getLastName(), getFirstName(), birthday);
    }

}
``` 
## TODOs
[ ] Validations: no validations are made. If the class is already immutable,
the static constructor, the getters and the with-methods will be generated anyway.
